# React Chip Input

## Specifications

- When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
- As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
- Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
- Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
- Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

## Bonus Task

- **Clean Code:** Codebase follows clean code practices for maintainability and readability.

- **TypeScript Implementation:** Implemented the project using TypeScript for enhanced type safety and development experience.

- **Backspace Highlight and Deletion:** When the input is blank, and the user presses backspace, the last chip (e.g., Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted. Pressing backspace again should delete the highlighted chip.

- **Tailwind CSS for styling**
